    CleverCash wallets look like most of the wallets you've known and loved until now - they're made of real leather, and hold your money and cards just the same.
    But our wallets are also different in a fundamental way.
</p>
    <p>
      We at CleverCash know that losing your wallet can be more than an inconvenience.
      That's why our wallets are designed with a focus on being easily retrievable in case you do experience this all too common issue.
      CleverCash wallets are designed with built-in, lightweight GPS technology that works with your smartphone to help you locate your wallet the moment it's known to be missing.
      It works by connecting to your smartphone via the CleverCash app, available on iOS, android, and other devices. <!-- Include specific info about other devices in the future. !-->
      The app lets you configure a maximum "wallet distance" - this is the most distance your wallet will be allowed to be from you before your phone begins to alert you that it's missing.
      Once the app knows it needs to find your wallet, it will display the route you need to take visually and help you get to your wallet as quickly as possible.
