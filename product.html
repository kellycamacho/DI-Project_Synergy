      CleverCash wallets are designed to be easily retrievable in case you lose them. They work with your smartphone to help you find them.
      It works by connecting to your smartphone via the CleverCash app, available on iOS, android, and other devices. <!-- Include specific info about other devices in the future. !-->
      The app lets you configure a maximum "wallet distance" - this is the most distance your wallet will be allowed to be from you before your phone begins to alert you that it's missing.
      Once the app knows it needs to find your wallet, it will display the route you need to take visually and help you get to your wallet as quickly as possible.

      <p>
        The wallet's GPS communicates with your smartphone via the CleverCash app.
        The app allows for two tracking modes - "off" and "on." If tracking mode is on, the app will alert you when your wallet exceeds its set range. If it's off, then it will not alert you at all.
        The app allows you to customize the ways in which it alerts you. You can choose to be alerted by any combination of ringing, vibrating, or popup notifications.
